- use searchParams prop when you need search params to fetch
  data on the server
  -- Data is fetched server-side before rendering
  -- Makes the page dynamically rendered

- use useSearchParams hook when Search params are for
  client-side filtering only (data already loaded)
  -- No server round-trip needed
  -- Instant filtering in the browser

- use new URLSearchParams(window.location.search) 
  when Reading params in event handlers/callbacks without
  causing re-renders
  -- Doesn't trigger component re-render when URL changes
  -- Good for one-time reads in callbacks
